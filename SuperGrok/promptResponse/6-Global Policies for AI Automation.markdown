## Key Points
- Research suggests a global agreement could help manage AI’s impact on jobs and economies fairly.
- It seems likely that taxing automation could fund support for displaced workers, though amounts vary.
- Evidence leans toward governments, businesses, and people all having roles to ensure AI benefits everyone.
- The topic is debated, with some worried about slowing innovation, while others focus on preventing inequality.

## Why Global Policies Matter
Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing how we work, with the potential to replace many jobs but also make businesses and governments more efficient. A global plan could help make sure these changes don’t leave people behind, especially those who lose their jobs. By working together, countries can avoid problems like companies moving to places with fewer rules, which could hurt workers everywhere.

## What Could the Plan Include?
A worldwide agreement might involve taxing companies that use AI to save money, using that cash to help workers learn new skills or get a basic income. It could also set rules to make sure AI is used fairly, without bias or harm. Countries would likely need to support each other, with richer nations helping poorer ones to keep things balanced.

## Who Does What?
Governments could collect taxes and fund training programs, businesses might need to be open about how they use AI, and everyday people could push for fair policies by supporting ethical companies. Everyone has a part to play to make sure AI helps more than it hurts.

# Comprehensive Report on Global Policies and Stakeholder Responsibilities for AI-Driven Automation

## Introduction
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation technologies is reshaping global economies, offering significant productivity gains while posing challenges such as job displacement and economic inequality. Building on analyses from previous sections, which estimated job losses of 500 million to 1 billion by 2030, potential government savings, and funding mechanisms like Universal Basic Income (UBI), this report proposes a global policy framework to manage these impacts. The framework aims to prevent negative outcomes, such as a "race to the bottom" in regulations, and ensure AI’s benefits are shared equitably across nations and stakeholders.

## Global Policy Framework

### The Need for Coordination
The interconnectedness of global markets means that AI-driven job losses or tax evasion in one region can affect others. Without coordination, countries might lower taxes or regulations to attract AI businesses, reducing funds for social programs like UBI and increasing inequality. A global agreement, inspired by models like the [Paris Climate Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement) and the [OECD’s global tax framework](https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/), can address these risks by setting common standards.

### Proposed Global Agreement
The "Global Agreement on AI and Automation" would include the following components:

1. **Global Minimum Tax on Automation**:
   - Countries would tax economic gains from automation, such as labor cost savings, at a minimum rate adjusted to national economic conditions.
   - Revenues would fund UBI and retraining programs, aligning with Section 5’s estimate of $5 trillion to $10 trillion needed annually for UBI.
   - This prevents companies from relocating to low-tax jurisdictions, ensuring stable funding.

2. **Ethical AI Standards**:
   - Guidelines would ensure AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable, addressing issues like bias and data privacy.
   - These build on existing frameworks, such as the [UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI](https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence), which emphasizes human rights and transparency.

3. **Worker Transition Guidelines**:
   - Nations would implement strategies for education, retraining, and job placement to support displaced workers, as discussed in Section 4.
   - This includes assessing AI’s impact on labor markets, as recommended by UNESCO’s Policy Area 10.

4. **International Cooperation**:
   - High-income countries would provide technology transfers and financial aid to low-income nations to build AI capabilities.
   - This ensures all countries can participate, reducing global disparities.

5. **Governance**:
   - A UN-affiliated AI Council would oversee implementation, monitor compliance, and facilitate collaboration.
   - Regular reporting and reviews would track progress and address challenges.
